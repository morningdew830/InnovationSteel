LICENSE AGREEMENT 2:
Innovation Steel SOFTWARE, INC.

Electronic End User License Agreement 

NOTICE TO USER: This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement.  Please read the Agreement carefully before using the Software.  It provides a license to use the Software and contains warranty information and liability disclaimers.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BECOME BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  You (“Licensee”) agree that this Agreement is like any written negotiated agreement signed by you.  The Agreement is enforceable against you and any legal entity that obtains the Software and on whose behalf it is used.  If you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Software.  The terms of this Agreement also apply to any Innovation Steel upgrades, patches, modified versions, updates, additions, copies of the Software licensed to you by Innovation Steel or third parties, and support services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
1. Definitions
1.1 "Innovation Steel" means Innovation Steel, Ilc.
1.2 “Software” means (a) all of the information with which this Agreement is provided, including but not limited to: (i) all software files and other computer files or information; (ii) sample and stock photographs, images, sounds, clip art and other artistic works bundled with Innovation Steel software; and (iii) related explanatory written materials and files (“Documentation”), and (b) any modified versions and copies of, upgrades, patches, updates, and additions to such information, provided to you by Innovation Steel or third parties on behalf of Innovation Steel at any time, to the extent not provided under separate terms (collectively, “Updates”).
1.3 "Physical Server" means a computing device running an operating system on which other software or utilities are installed.  The operating system runs directly on the hardware of the device, not in an emulated or virtualized environment.  A Virtual Server is not a Physical Server. 
1.4 "Virtual Server" means software implementation of a computing device that executes programs like a physical machine but is not directly running as the operating system for the physical machine on which the software implementation is running (also referred to as an emulator or guest operating system).
2. License Grants
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Innovation Steel grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Software on compatible devices. You may install and use the Software as permitted by the license type purchased and as described in this Agreement. The license type purchased is specified either in the product or on the product receipt or invoice.
3. License Types
3.1 Single Seat License: Under the terms of a Single Seat License, the Software is licensed for use by one user on one device at a time.  This license type may also be referred to as a “Local” License.  The Single Seat License permits you to use the Software on more than one computer system, e.g., a desktop computer and a laptop computer normally used by the same person at different times, provided that there is no possibility that the Software will be used on more than one computer system simultaneously; any such simultaneous use requires a separate license for each computer system. 
3.2 Floating Seat License: Under the terms of a Floating Seat License, the Software may be used on one private network on different devices at the same time up to the number of Floating Seat Licenses purchased.  This license type may also be referred to as a “License Manager” License.  The Software may be installed on multiple computers or computing devices, but the number of concurrent, licensed instances of the Software at any one time may not exceed the number of Floating Seat Licenses purchased.  
3.3 Trial License: A Trial License may be used only to review, demonstrate and evaluate the Software for a limited time period. The Trial Version of the Software may have limited features and may cease operating after a predetermined amount of time or number of uses based on a metering mechanism within the Trial License as determined solely by Innovation Steel.
3.4 Academic License: Under the terms of an Academic License, the Software may only be used by a student or a faculty/staff member for educational purposes while actively studying or teaching at an educational institution and for no other purpose. The Academic Version of the Software may have limited features and will cease operating after a predetermined amount of time. An Academic License may not be shared or used at the same time on different devices. Academic Licenses may not be used for commercial, professional, or for-profit purposes.  

3.5 Subscription License: Under the terms of a Subscription License you may use one copy of the Software for the specified term of the Subscription License.  The term of the Subscription License begins on a date you choose for the start of your subscription and continues for the term specified when you subscribe to the product.  If the term is not specified when you subscribe to the product, then the term is thirty (30) days. The Subscription License will terminate if the Licensee fails to comply with any term or condition in this Agreement, including failure to pay associated fees when due. In case of termination, Licensee will not be entitled to a refund of amount paid for the license to use the Software, or any other amounts for any reason. Software with a Subscription License may contain a device that limits Software usage in accordance with the license.
3.6 Freeware License: Under the terms of a Freeware License, one individual is licensed to use the Software on one computer or computing device at a time.  The Freeware Version of the Software has limited features. The Freeware user may use the Freeware License for evaluation or production purposes. The Software licensed under the Freeware License is not eligible for product support.
4. Licensing Requirements and Restrictions
4.1 Virtualization Technology: The Software may be installed within a virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system so long as the use of the Software meets the terms of the license type. Floating Seat Licenses are the only license types that permit virtual system uses. Virtualization technology may not be used to circumvent other licensing terms and restrictions.
4.2 Non-Human Devices: Non-human devices that utilize the Software without interaction are counted as users. Each device that runs the Software must be properly licensed to use the Software with one of the license types described herein. Examples of non-human devices include, but are not limited to, virtual PCs, build servers, unattended PCs for batch jobs, etc.
4.3 Backups: Regardless of which version of the Software you have acquired, you may not make any copies of the software.
4.4 Prior Versions: Prior versions of the Software may be installed on the same computer with a properly licensed current version of Software. A prior version may be used by a properly licensed user in place of the current version of the software. The prior version is not an additional license of the Software; it may be used only as a substitute for the current version.
4.5 Audit: You agree that Innovation Steel may audit your use of the Software for compliance with these terms at any time, upon reasonable notice. In the event that such audit reveals any use of the Software by you other than in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement, you shall reimburse Innovation Steel for all reasonable expenses related to such audit in addition to any other liabilities you may incur as a result of such non-compliance.
4.6 The Software is licensed as a single product. The Software and its constituent parts may not be reverse engineered, decompiled, disassembled or separated for use on more than one computer, nor placed for distribution, sale, or resale as individual creations by you.  You may not alter, merge, adapt or translate the Software, or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-perceivable form.  You may not modify the Software or create derivative works based upon the Software.
4.7 The provision of source code, if included with the Software, does not constitute transfer of any legal rights to such code, and resale or distribution of all or any portion of all source code and intellectual property will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all applicable local, federal and international laws. All Innovation Steel Software and other files remain Innovation Steel's exclusive property. If source code or modifiable files are provided, regardless of any modifications that you make, you may not redistribute them unless Innovation Steel has expressly designated these as re-distributable. 
4.8 Other than as expressly set forth in Sections 2, 3, and 4, you may not make or distribute copies of the Software, or electronically transfer the Software from one computer to another or over a network.

Unless otherwise expressly authorized in a separate written agreement between, and executed by, you and Innovation Steel, you may not use, or permit the use of, the Software on a timeshare or service bureau basis. In addition, unless otherwise expressly authorized in a separate written agreement between, and executed by you and Innovation Steel, you may not host, on a subscription basis or otherwise, the Software to permit a third party to use the Software for any reason.
4.10 Unless otherwise provided herein, you shall not (A) in the aggregate, install or use more than one copy of the Trial Version of the Software, (B) download the Trial Version of the Software under more than one username, (C) alter the contents of a hard drive or computer system to enable the use of the Trial Version of the Software for an aggregate period in excess of the trial period for one license to such Trial Version, (D) disclose the results of software performance benchmarks obtained using the Trial Version to any third party without Innovation Steel's prior written consent, (E) use the Trial Version for any application deployment or ultimate production purpose, or (F) use the Trial Version of the Software for a purpose other than the sole purpose of determining whether to purchase a license to the Software; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, you are strictly prohibited from installing or using the Trial Version of the Software for any commercial training purpose.
4.11 You may not use the Software to create any product that directly or indirectly competes with the Software.
4.12 You may not export the Software into any country prohibited by the United States Export Administration Act and the regulations thereunder.
4.13 If the Software was purchased with an Enterprise License Manager, in the event that you are installing the Software on a Physical Server, you will be required to purchase and install the latest version of Enterprise License Manager - Physical Edition to use the Software, and if you are installing the Software on a Virtual Server, you will be required to purchase the latest version of Enterprise License Manager - Virtual Edition to use the Software.  In the event that you install the Software on a Physical Server or Virtual Server and thereafter want to install the Software on the other type of server, you will be required to purchase the other version of Enterprise License Manager in order to use the Software on such other server.  Enterprise License Manager allows Innovation Steel to track the use of the Software on the applicable Physical Server or Virtual Server, and your installation of the Software will constitute your agreement that Innovation Steel may utilize Enterprise License Manager for such purposes. 
4.14 If the Software includes, or, in connection with the acquisition of the Software you receive, two or more operating environment versions of the Software (e.g. Macintosh® and Windows®), two or more language translation versions of the Software, the same Software on two or more media, and/or you otherwise receive two or more copies of the Software, you may use only one copy of one version of the Software. 
4.15 If the Software was purchased with a Floating Seat License, you may not permit the number of individuals simultaneously logged in to the Software to exceed such number of floating seats permitted by the license to the Software purchased by you.
4.16 Innovation Steel may adopt from time to time such mechanical or electronic methods it deems necessary or appropriate to control unauthorized use or distribution of the Software. Such methods may require that the Software be used only with a protection device or code provided to you by Innovation Steel. If a hardware device is lost, it may only be replaced for the cost of a new license.  Damaged hardware devices may be replaced after the damaged device has been returned to Innovation Steel.
4.17 At the sole discretion of Innovation Steel, certain ancillary features and services may from time to time be made available to you for use with the Software (the "Ancillary Services").  An example of such Ancillary Services, without limitation, is the use of Project Express with the Software, if such Ancillary Service has been made available to you by Innovation Steel at the time of your acquisition of this License.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and at the sole discretion of Innovation Steel (a) any or all of such Ancillary Services may be modified or discontinued and/or (b) the availability or continued availability of such Ancillary Services may require the payment by you of a separate service fee in an amount determined by Innovation Steel in its sole discretion.  Any such service fees will be in addition to your License fees and maintenance fees and/or other fees or amounts paid to or charged by Innovation Steel.  In no event will any Ancillary Services be available to you (with or without payment of an additional service fee) if you do not participate in the Innovation Steel maintenance program or if you are not current on all required payments to Innovation Steel.
4.18 If the Licensee is making payments in accordance with a payment plan and fails to pay a fee when due, the License will terminate and can be deactivated. In case of termination, Licensee will not be entitled to a refund of the amount paid for the license to use the Software, or any other amounts for any reason. Software offered with a payment plan may contain a device that limits Software usage in accordance with the license.
4.19 Circumvention: Licensee may not utilize any equipment, device, software, or other means designed to circumvent or remove any form of copy protection used by Innovation Steel in connection with the Software, or use the Software together with any authorization code, serial number, or other copy-protection device not supplied by Innovation Steel directly or through an authorized distributor.  In the case of network versions, the Licensee may not utilize any equipment, device, software, or other means designed to circumvent or remove the Innovation Steel Enterprise License Manager (if any). The Licensee may not utilize any equipment, device, software, or other means designed to circumvent or remove any usage restrictions, or to enable functionality disabled by Innovation Steel.  
4.20 If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta software (“Pre-release Software”), then this section applies.  The Pre-release Software is a pre-release version, does not represent final product from Innovation Steel, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss.  Innovation Steel may never commercially release the Pre-release Software.  You will promptly return or destroy all copies of Pre-release Software upon the earlier of Innovation Steel’s request or upon Innovation Steel’s commercial release of such Software.
